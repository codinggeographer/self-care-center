The Self-Care Center was developed as part of a solo challenge for Module 1 curriculum at the Turing School of Software Engineering & Design. The goal was to gain experience building a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also demonstrating an understanding of event handling and user interface design. The project incorporated a Harry Potter theme to add a touch of creativity and personalization.
